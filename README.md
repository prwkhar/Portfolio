## About
This is the portfolio website made using Next.js.
This showcases my About info , project info and contact info in a modern and responsive UI format.Small game integration makes this portfolion website unique and fun to engage with.

## What was your favourite part?
My favourite part was building the tictactoe game inside it.
I got the idea that to make the website interesting I can build a small game or something. So for that I choose tictactoe. To download my CV u first have to defeat the bot.

## Hardest part
Hardest part was to make the logic for a decent autoplay bot. I first started with random generation of move but that was very bad. Therefore I had to implement some logic to make it a decent level bot to play with.
